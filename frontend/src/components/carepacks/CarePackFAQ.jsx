    question: 'Who is eligible for a Welcome Care Pack?',
    answer: 'Welcome Care Packs are available to LGBTQ+ newcomers, immigrants, and refugees who have arrived in Canada within the last 12 months. We operate on an honor system and trust that those who request a pack truly need one.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does shipping take?',
    answer: 'Once you submit your application, our volunteers pack your box within 5 business days. Standard shipping within Canada typically takes an additional 3 to 7 business days depending on your province or territory.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there really no cost?',
    answer: 'Yes, it is 100% free! Thanks to the generous support of our donors, community partners, and volunteers, we cover all costs for the items and shipping.'
